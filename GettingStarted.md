  * We will assume you've already installed the .NET framework listed above in the requirements section.

**Instructions:**

  1. Extract the latest RunUO release to your desktop folder

  1. Modify your path to include the directory to which you installed Ultima Online as shown:![http://www.runuo.com/ryan/runuo_tutorial_datapath.png](http://www.runuo.com/ryan/runuo_tutorial_datapath.png)
